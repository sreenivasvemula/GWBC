===Gosu Language Best Practices ===
* Gosu Naming and Declaration Best Practices
** Observe General Gosu Naming Conventions
** Omit Type Specifications with Variable Initialization
** Add a Suffix to Functions and Classes to Avoid Name Conflicts
** Declare Functions Private Unless Absolutely Necessary
** Use Public Properties Instead of Public Variables
** Do Not Declare Static Scope for Mutable Variables

* Gosu Commenting Best Practices
** Block Comments
** Javadoc Comments
** Single-line Comments
** Trailing Comments
** Using Comment Delimiters to Disable Code
* Gosu Coding Best Practices 
** Use Whitespace Effectively
** Use Parentheses Effectively
** Use Curly Braces Effectively
** Program Defensively Against Conditions that Can Fail
*** Use case-insensitive comparisons
*** Check for null values
*** Allow default null-safe property access
*** Use explicit null-safe operators
*** Check boundary conditions
*** Use structured exception handling
** Omit Semicolons as Statement Delimiters
** Use != Instead of <> as the Inequality Operator
** Observe Null Safety with Equality Operators 
*** Rewrite Comparison Operators to Avoid the Equals Method
*** Avoid Implicit Type Coercion with Comparison Operators
** Use typeis Expressions for Automatic Downcasting
** Observe Loop Control Best Practices
*** Implement Conditional Operators in Loop Conditions Correctly
*** Interrupt Loop Execution as Early as Possible
** Return from Functions as Early as Possible
** Use Query Builder APIs instead of Find Expressions in New Code
* Gosu Performance Best Practices
** Use the Fastest Technique for String Concatenation 
** Consider the Order of Terms in Compound Expressions
*** With and Expressions, Place Terms Likely to Fail Earlier
*** With or Expressions, Place Terms Likely to Pass Earlier
** Avoid Repeated Method Calls Within an Algorithm
** Remove Constant Variables and Expressions from Loops
** Avoid Doubly Nested Loop Constructs
** Pull Up Multiple Performance Intensive Method Calls
** Be Wary of Dot Notation with Object Access Paths
** Avoid Code that Incidentally Queries the Database
